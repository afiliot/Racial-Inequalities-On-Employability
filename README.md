# Econometrics project on How Racial Inequalities Affect Employability

This project is part of my second year training at ENSAE ParisTech (Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique). 
It aims at studying the effects of a various range of variables that may be related to the residential zones or the origin on emplyability and salary of 70 944 individuals. The datas are based from a INSEE study where these individuals were repeatedly interrogated on a three month basis.

You'll find in this repo : the wording and the corresponding project report. The code was performed on Stata and R. It princippaly consisted in applying panel methods, latent variable models and duration models. 

The code isn't provided here as it deals with private datas.
